# Hello, Tensor World!

Let’s analyze the Hello World script you ran. For reference, I’ve added the code below.

```bash
import tensorflow as tf

# Create TensorFlow object called hello_constant
hello_constant = tf.constant('Hello World!')

with tf.Session() as sess:
    # Run the tf.constant operation in the session
    output = sess.run(hello_constant)
    print(output)
```

## Tensor

```bash
In TensorFlow, data isn’t stored as integers, floats, or strings.
These values are encapsulated in an object called a tensor.
In the case of hello_constant = tf.constant('Hello World!'),
hello_constant is a 0-dimensional string tensor, but tensors come in a variety of sizes as shown below:
```

```bash
# !/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding:utf-8 -*-
# @Copyright (C), 2018, matrix

import tensorflow as tf

# Create Tensorflow as tf
hello_constant = tf.constant('Hello World!')

with tf.Session() as sess:
    # run the tf.constant operation in the session
    output = sess.run(hello_constant)
    print(output)

# A is a 0-dimensional int32 tensor
A = tf.constant(1234)
# B is a 1-dimensional int32 tensor
B = tf.constant([123, 456, 789])
# C is a 2-dimensional int32 tensor
C = tf.constant([[123, 456, 789], [222, 333, 444]])
print(A)
print(B)
print(C)
```

>run result

```bash
b'Hello World!'
Tensor("Const_1:0", shape=(), dtype=int32)
Tensor("Const_2:0", shape=(3,), dtype=int32)
Tensor("Const_3:0", shape=(2, 3), dtype=int32)
```

```bash
tf.constant() is one of many TensorFlow operations you will use in this lesson.
The tensor returned by tf.constant() is called a constant tensor, because the value of the tensor never changes.
```

## Session

```bash
TensorFlow’s api is built around the idea of a computational graph, a way of visualizing a mathematical process which you learned about in the MiniFlow lesson. Let’s take the TensorFlow code you ran and turn that into a graph:
```

![All text](http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/dc05ba18gy1fnbfk9gy04j20jg0a9dgc.jpg)

```bash
A "TensorFlow Session", as shown above, is an environment for running a graph.
```

The session is in charge of allocating the operations to GPU(s) and/or CPU(s), including remote machines. Let’s see how you use it.

```bash
with tf.Session() as sess:
    output = sess.run(hello_constant)
    print(output)
```

The code has already created the tensor, hello_constant, from the previous lines. The next step is to evaluate the tensor in a session.

The code creates a session instance, sess, using tf.Session.

The sess.run() function then evaluates the tensor and returns the results.

After you run the above, you will see the following printed out

```bash
'Hello World!'
```
