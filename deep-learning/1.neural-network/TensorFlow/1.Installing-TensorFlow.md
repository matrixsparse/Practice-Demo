You’ll use TensorFlow to classify images from the notMNIST dataset

a dataset of images of English letters from A to J. You can see a few example images below.

Your goal is to automatically detect the letter based on the image in the dataset

You’ll be working on your own computer for this lab, so, first things first, install TensorFlow!

## Install

As usual, we'll be using Conda to install TensorFlow

You might already have a TensorFlow environment, but check to make sure you have all the necessary packages.

### OS X or Linux

Run the following commands to setup your environment

```bash
conda create -n tensorflow python=3.6
source activate tensorflow
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter notebook scipy scikit-learn
pip install tensorflow
```

## Hello, world!

```bash

# !/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding:utf-8 -*-
# @Copyright (C), 2018, matrix

import tensorflow as tf

# Create TensorFlow object called tensor
hello_constant = tf.constant('Hello World!')

with tf.Session() as sess:
    # Run the tf.constant operation in the session
    output = sess.run(hello_constant)
    print(output)
```

>Run Result

```bash
b'Hello World!'
```

>To deactivate an active environment

```bash
source deactivate
```
